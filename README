c_map is a string -> string map implementation in C using AVL trees as the
backing store. 

NOTE: this is very out-of-date. I integrated the structure into an IRC bot, and
there the it actually had a chance to mature. I may think about merging
commits into here relevant to it, but until then just look there for usable
code.

I kind of want to mess around with macro concatenation to get the thing to be
"generic" in the sense that you pass the type to a macro which generates the
corresponding class key_valueMap or something similar to that. Then you would
pass function pointers for things like the comparator and what-not.

Building:
	make

Running:
	./cmap
	Runs a little demo that does ASCII to Morse code

Extending:
	Read the bmap.h and bmap.c file. Figure out how to use it based on main.c,
	it should be simple enough ;)
